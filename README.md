## Project 

Nutshell is a dashboard for people to use to organize their daily tasks, events, news article, friends, and chat message built on React. Data was stored locally using json.

## A Note About Authentication

The login and registration code we have given you is fake, completely insecure, and would never be implemented in a professional application. It is a simulation authentication using very simplistic tools, because authentication is not a learning objective of students at NSS.

You will be using [session storage](https://javascript.info/localstorage#sessionstorage) to keep track of which user has logged into Nutshell. You need to read the code in the **`LoginForm`** and **`RegisterForm`** components so that you see what is going on, but you do not need to change it. However, you will have to use a custom message that is being dispatched by those components.
